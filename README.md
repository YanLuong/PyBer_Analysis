# PyBer Analysis

### Overview and purpose of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to analyze ride sharing data on behalf of a ride sharing app company called PyBer. The focus is on how the data such as fares varies between the three different city types (urban, suburban and rural) of interest. We will be using Pandas and Matplotlib summarise and visualise the results. 

### Results

After aggregating the data of the different city types, we can see that there are some key differences between them. In this analysis, covering a specific date range, the bulk of the rides is in urban cities accounting for 68% of the total rides. Suburban rides accounting for 26% and rural rides for only 5% of the total rides. As there are considerably more rides in the urban cities, it also makes sense that urban cities also have more drivers to meet the demand. There are a total 2973 drivers in this analysis, 2405 of those drivers are in urban cities (81%), 490 (16%) in suburban areas and 78 (2.6%) in rural areas. Urban city type also accounted 63% ($39,854) of the total fares earned while suburban accounted for 30% and rural for 7%. We can see that the urban city type account for most of the data in total rides, total drivers and total fares and the rural city type accounting for the least as it is less densely populated. However, it is interesting to note that the rural city type rides cost the most with the average fare per ride at $34.62 and average fare per driver at $55.49. This could be due to the fact that there is less drivers so that rate is higher. Where as the c
